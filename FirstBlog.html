        anyways I would like to let you know this website is a blog website and that I am a dummy who<br>
      barely knows how to make a blog website.<br>
       Well let's get back on topic on why I hate furries.(note I don't endorse hate on all furries what I am talking about are the bad furries)<br>
       1.Furries are annoying<br>
       UwU OwO My ass<br>
       2.They are vegan and they have to announce it every .1 milisecond<br>
       Of course since they are cringe animals they have to be vegan so they don't commit canibalism<br>
       3. They are always cat or dog<br>
       Be creative for once<br>
       4. They hate Filipinos<br>
       atleast we can eat meat<br>
       I ran out of ideas so I asked people on <ahref=" brick-hill.com">BrickHill<a>why they hated furries<br>
       Here are some responses by few of you.(if you even looked at this)<br>
       they are always sexualized- Diarrhealover123<br>
       they are happier than me- CUS<br>
       Well not all furries are bad but these are the stupid dumb furries we all hate(konekokitten)<br>
