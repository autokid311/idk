Brick hill is a website I go on sometimes.<br>
Sometimes things.... well are plain stupid.<br>
Like this person named crow_ said,"when the baka<br>
is the sussiest of them allðŸ˜³."WHO SAYS THAT!?<BR>
I remember once this  MalaysianSulthan guy<br>
dressed up as Hatsune Miku once. He still denies<br>
the fact that he loves miku.<br>
Oh and religious discussions<br>
If you watched laughability on brick hill you know<br>
religious discussions. Ugly a** h** b****(or something<br>
like that.) Oh and everyone hates laughability because<br>
he called brick-hill bad. In all honesty, Brick-Hill was<br>
never great.It was decent. Yeah it is fun talking on the<br>
forums but really the forums have been dry and spacebuilder<br>
is sitting in a chair counting the days since he announced the<br>
new client that will never be released. I have nothing else to<
say brick-hill is good <br>
